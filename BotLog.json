He came from a poor family of peasants and spent his early years taking care of swine. A rich benefactor sent him to school. At the age of 19, he was ordained priest.<br><br>He had a rather self-seeking start in the priesthood. Under the influence of his spiritual directors, he underwent a striking conversation in which he gave his life over to God in service of the poor. For a few years, he was pastor of a parish and then a chaplain to the galley slaves in Paris. But it was in preaching missions and teaching the peasants in the country side that he found his special calling. He gathered a group of priests who assisted him in conducting missions. The group subsequently became the Congregation of the Mission (1625), a community of priests and brothers whose end is 'to preach the good news to the poor.'<br>Eager to reform the life and training of the clergy, he and his community also organized retreats and established seminaries. In 1633 he gathered together a group of simple girls to minister to the sick poor with the assistance of St. Louise de Marillac. Today this community is known as the Daughters of Charity. He also established the Confraternities of Charity and the Ladies of Charity (lay organizations) to assist the poor.<br>When he died on September 27, 1660, all of Paris mourned for him. The Church honors St. Vincent on this day. He is known throughout the world today as the patron of all charitable associations. His spirituality lives on in hundreds of thousands of laymen and women, priests, sisters and brothers who follow in his footsteps.<br>On August 3, 1728, Pope Benedict XIII declared Vincent 'Blessed'. Pope Leo XII constituted him 'Universal Patron of Charity' on April 16, 1885. His life-size statue stands in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.<br><br>St. Vincent de Paul is the Patron Saint of Adamson University. Inspired by his example, the Vincentian community at Adamson University is committed to provide education particularly to the socially disadvantaged. They believe that education is one of the best ways to develop the human person and to uplift the social condition of the marginalized sectors of society."}
